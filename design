To generate a histogram of the scores found in the file we can use the following code:
1. Open the file and use the readscores module to read the scores into a list of dictionaries.
2. Isolate the score from the dictionary and use the histogram module of matplotlib.pyplot to generate a histogram of the scores.
3. Label the Title, x-axis label, and y-axis label. Also apply an outline to the bars.
4. Display the histogram.
