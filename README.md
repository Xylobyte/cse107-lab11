# CSE107 - Lab 11

This lab uses matplotlib to plot graphs of sat and act scores from an inpit file.

## Purpose

### scorebar.py

This program takes a file of act and sat scores by state and generates two graphs
of the data. The first graph is a bar graph of the averages for all states.
The second graph is a bar graph of the states where the percentage of sat
takers is above 50% and the percentage of act takers is below 50%. It uses
the matplotlib library to plot the graphs.

### scorehist.py

This program opens a file of act and sat scores by state and generates a histogram
of the average act scores. It uses the matplotlib library to plot the histogram.

## Conclusion

* In this lab I practiced opening files and using the data to generate graphs using
  the matplotlib library.
* Pair programming aided in giving me an outside look at my code
  and allowed me to ask questions and give help to my partner when
  it was needed.
* I did not work with my buddy on the lab.
* I did not have any significant problems other than minor syntax errors while
  working on this lab.
* I think I could improve my code by changing [scorebar.py](#scorebarpy) so that
  it diplays both graphs in the same window.
